[Verse 1]
We're fighting every day
I've got no words left to say
I think I'm moving on
We tried our best
These words have been on my chest
I think I'm moving on

[Pre-Chorus]
We're too young to have this many problems
Too old for all of the drama
Don't know where it went wrong
I love you too much to drag this out farther
Hate that we're not meant for each other
It's better now, than to carry on

[Chorus]
I think we're moving on
I think we're moving on
I think we're moving on

[Verse 2]
In a couple years
I'll see you out having beers
With someone you belong
Hе'll treat you right
Give you cuddles еvery night
He will hold you tight
Like I would always fight
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

We're too young to have this many problems
Too old for all of the drama
Don't know where it went wrong
I love you too much to drag this out farther
Hate that we're not meant for each other
It's better now, than to carry on

[Chorus]
I think we're moving on
I think we're moving on
I think we're moving on

[Outro]
So close, no one knows me any better
So far from our first days together
Staying up, dusk 'til dawn
Can't believe we're moving on
Can't believe we're moving on
I can't believe we're moving on
