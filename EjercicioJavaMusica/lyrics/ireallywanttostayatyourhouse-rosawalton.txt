[Verse 1]
I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboards
But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign
Another evening, I'll be sitting reading in-between your lines
Because I miss you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
There's no end of the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
And let yourself go
Is that a compromise?

[Chorus]
So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Causе I really wanna stay at your house
In the palacе, it all works out
But you know how much you fuck me up
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
And I'm aware that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your si-i-ide
So, when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
And why do I still want to call you? (Call you, call you, call you)

[Chorus]
So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
In the palace, it all works out
But you know how much you fuck me up
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you, I don't wanna know

[Bridge]
You
Oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
I don't know where I'm going

[Pre-Chorus]
So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
There's no end of the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
And let yourself go
Is that a compromise?


[Chorus]
So, what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
In the palace, it all works out
But you know how much you fuck me up
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you, I don't wanna know
