[Verse 1]
Come along with me
And the butterflies and bees
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Come along with me
To a cliff under a tree
Where we can gaze upon the water
As an everlasting dream

[Chorus]
All of my collections
I'll share them all with you
Maybe by next summer
We won't have changed our tunes

[Verse 2]
We'll still want to be
With the butterflies and bees
Making up new numbers
And living so merrily

[Chorus]
All of my collections
I'll share them all with you
I'll be here for you always
And always be with you

[Outro]
Come along with me
And the butterflies and bees
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Living so merrily
